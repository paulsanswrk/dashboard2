This is a Nuxt/Supabase app.

The Optiqo application is a robust business intelligence and data visualization platform. It is designed to assist users in a comprehensive workflow, from connecting to data sources and analyzing information to creating and sharing interactive dashboards and reports. The application appears to be a multi-faceted tool for both technical users (data connection) and business users (dashboard creation
and reporting).

admin.optiqo.report is the existing system we are replicating and improving. The most signoficant improvement is adding AI for chart building.

Please don't start Nuxt yourself. This results in many instances running simultaneously. I start Nuxt manually when needed.

Please don't edit .env file.

We are on Ubuntu 24.

Every button should have a background or outline, cursor: pointer and change its look on hover.

We use Drizzle for server-side Supabase queries. Schema is defined in lib/db/schema.ts.

Supabase project id is bnhhjzcitgaczpojzkxd. You can use MCP for Supabase access.

In this project we use a single master branch, pelase don't create any other branches.
