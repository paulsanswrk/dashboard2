# Authentication Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Supabase authentication in the Optiqo Dashboard application, including the migration from custom API-based authentication to Supabase's built-in authentication system.

## Problem Statement

The initial authentication implementation had several issues:
- Users could sign up/in but the app didn't recognize authentication status
- Custom API endpoints were used instead of Supabase's built-in authentication
- Manual profile management instead of leveraging Supabase's reactive user state
- Complex cookie checking and manual session management
- Authentication state wasn't properly synchronized across components
- **Email confirmation was not enforced** - users could access the app without confirming their email
- **Profile creation API had database schema mismatches** causing signup failures
- **Error handling in server routes was inconsistent** leading to unclear error messages

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **useAuth Composable** (`composables/useAuth.ts`)
2. **Auth Middleware** (`middleware/auth.ts`)
3. **App Initialization** (`app.vue`)
4. **Profile Creation API** (`server/api/auth/create-profile.post.ts`)
5. **UI Components** (Login, Signup, AppLayout, Email Confirmation)
6. **Email Confirmation Flow** (`pages/signup/confirm-email.vue`, `pages/auth/callback.vue`)
7. **Magic Link Authentication** (Passwordless sign-in and sign-up)

```

## Implementation Details

### 1. useAuth Composable

**Key Changes:**
- Added Supabase integration using `useSupabaseClient()` and `useSupabaseUser()`
- Replaced custom API calls with Supabase's built-in methods
- Added reactive user state management
- Implemented proper error handling with success/error messages
- Added profile creation during signup
- Added user watcher for automatic profile loading

**Key Features:**
```typescript
// Reactive user state
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const isAuthenticated = computed(() => !!user.value)

// Profile management
const userProfile = ref<UserProfile | null>(null)
const loadUserProfile = async () => { /* ... */ }

// Authentication methods
const signUp = async (email, password, firstName, lastName, role, organizationName) => { /* ... */ }
const signIn = async (email, password) => { /* ... */ }
const signOut = async () => { /* ... */ }

// Magic link authentication
const signInWithMagicLink = async (email) => { /* ... */ }
const signUpWithMagicLink = async (email, firstName, lastName, role, organizationName) => { /* ... */ }

// Email confirmation
const resendConfirmationEmail = async (email) => { /* ... */ }
```

### 2. Auth Middleware

**Simplified Logic:**
- Uses Supabase's `useSupabaseUser()` instead of custom profile fetching
- Removed manual cookie checking
- Added database validation for security
- Cleaner, more reliable authentication checks

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to, from) => {
  const user = useSupabaseUser()
  const supabase = useSupabaseClient()
  
  if (!user.value) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
  
  // Validate user exists in database
  try {
    const { data: profile, error } = await supabase
      .from('profiles')
      .select('user_id')
      .eq('user_id', user.value.id)
      .single()
    
    if (error) {
      await supabase.auth.signOut()
      return navigateTo('/login')
    }
  } catch (err) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

### 3. App Initialization

**Simplified Structure:**
- Removed manual authentication initialization
- Leverages Supabase's built-in reactivity
- Cleaner component structure

**Template:**
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <AppLayout v-if="isAuthenticated">
      <NuxtPage />
    </AppLayout>
    <NuxtPage v-else />
  </div>
</template>
```

### 4. Profile Creation API

**Server-side Profile Management:**
- Handles profile creation with service role (bypasses RLS)
- Creates organizations for admin users during signup
- Proper error handling and validation
- Supports optiqo-dashboard's organization-based structure
- **Fixed database schema alignment** for reliable profile creation

**Key Features:**
- Organization creation for admin users
- Profile updates for existing users
- Error handling for database operations
- Service role authentication for RLS bypass
- **Correct field mapping** (user_id, first_name, last_name, role, organization_id)
- **Improved error handling** with proper error propagation

### 5. UI Components

**Updated Components:**
- **Login Page**: Uses new authentication methods, improved typography and spacing, **magic link authentication option with proper font styling and flexbox alignment**

- Proper error handling for confirmation failures
- Seamless redirect flow after confirmation

### 7. Magic Link Authentication

**New Implementation:**
- **Passwordless Sign-In**: Users can sign in using only their email address
- **Passwordless Sign-Up**: New users can create accounts without passwords
- **Profile Creation**: Magic link signups automatically create user profiles with provided information
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside traditional password authentication
- **Authorization Code Flow**: Handles both implicit and authorization code flows for magic links

**Key Features:**
- **Login Page**: Toggle between password and magic link authentication with proper font styling
- **Signup Page**: Toggle between password and magic link registration with required profile info
- **Profile Requirements**: Magic link signup requires first name, last name, and organization info
- **Auth Callback**: Enhanced callback handling with smart redirect logic and error handling
- **User Experience**: Clear messaging, intuitive toggles, and proper button alignment with flexbox
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for expired, invalid, and failed magic links
- **Smart Redirects**: Immediate redirect for already authenticated users without auth parameters

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Supabase's `signInWithOtp()` method for magic link generation
- Handles both hash fragment and query parameter authentication flows
- Automatic session processing without manual code exchange
- Enhanced debugging and logging for troubleshooting
- Fallback mechanisms for session verification

## Database Integration

### Profile Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('ADMIN', 'EDITOR')) NOT NULL,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);
```

### Organization Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  viewer_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
- Profiles table has RLS policies
- Organizations table has RLS policies
- Service role used for profile creation (bypasses RLS)

### 2. Authentication Flow
- Supabase handles secure authentication
- JWT tokens managed automatically
- Session validation on each request

### 3. Profile Validation
- Middleware validates user exists in database
- Prevents orphaned sessions
- Automatic session cleanup
