The screenshot shows a data visualization dashboard. In the top toolbar, there are several icons that typically represent different chart types available for selection. I will list them in the order they appear and describe them.

Based on the visible icons in the toolbar (just below "Enter title for your visualization"), here is the description:

1.  Table/Grid: An icon with horizontal lines, suggesting a basic data table or grid view.
    
2.  Bar/Column Chart: An icon with vertical bars of varying heights.
    
3.  Line Chart: An icon with a connected line, indicating a trend visualization.
    
4.  Area Chart: An icon showing the area beneath a line filled in.
    
5.  Pie/Donut Chart: A circular chart divided into slices.
    
6.  Funnel/Pyramid Chart: A vertical shape narrowing towards the bottom, often used for process flow or stages.
    
7.  Gauge/Dial Chart: A semi-circular chart with a needle, used to show a value against a scale.
    
8.  Map/Geographic Visualization: An icon resembling a map of the world or a specific region.
    
9.  Scatter Plot: An icon with small dots spread across a plane.
    
10.  Treemap: An icon showing nested rectangles of varying sizes.
     
11.  Pivot Table: An icon with a grid structure and arrows, often used for cross-tabulation of data.
     
12.  Sankey/Flow Diagram: An icon showing connected bands of varying widths, representing flow.
     

Here is the description formatted for the user:

"The visualization toolbar contains a series of icons representing different chart types. These icons, from left to right, appear to be:

1.  Table/Grid: Icon with horizontal lines.
    
2.  Bar/Column Chart: Icon with vertical bars.
    
3.  Line Chart: Icon with a single connected line.
    
4.  Area Chart: Icon showing a filled area under a line.
    
5.  Pie/Donut Chart: Circular chart divided into segments.
    
6.  Funnel/Pyramid Chart: Icon with a narrowing vertical shape.
    
7.  Gauge/Dial Chart: Semi-circular icon with a pointer.
    
8.  Map/Geographic Visualization: Icon resembling a world map.
    
9.  Scatter Plot: Icon with several small dots.
    
10.  Treemap: Icon with nested, size-varying rectangles.
     
11.  Pivot Table: Icon with a structured grid and directional arrows.
     
12.  Sankey/Flow Diagram: Icon showing connected, width-varying bands."
     

I do not need to use the google:search tool as all the necessary information is visible within the provided image.The visualization toolbar in the attached screenshot displays a sequence of icons, each representing a different type of chart or data display.

Here is a brief description of the types of charts shown, from left to right:

1.  Table/Grid: An icon with horizontal lines, suggesting a basic spreadsheet or data table view.
    
2.  Bar/Column Chart: An icon with vertical bars of varying heights, typically used for comparing different categories.
    
3.  Line Chart: An icon with a single connected line, primarily for visualizing trends over time or continuous data.
    
4.  Area Chart: An icon showing the area beneath a connected line filled in, similar to a line chart but emphasizing volume.
    
5.  Pie/Donut Chart: A circular chart divided into slices, used to show parts of a whole.
    
6.  Funnel/Pyramid Chart: A vertical shape narrowing towards the bottom, often used to illustrate stages in a process (e.g., sales pipeline).
    
7.  Gauge/Dial Chart: A semi-circular chart with a needle, typically used to display a single value against a specified range or goal.
    
8.  Map/Geographic Visualization: An icon resembling a world map, used for displaying data on a geographical context.
    
9.  Scatter Plot: An icon with several small dots, used to show the relationship between two variables.
    
10.  Treemap: An icon showing nested rectangles of varying sizes, used to display hierarchical data using size and color.
     
11.  Pivot Table: An icon with a structured grid and arrows, representing a tool for summarizing and reorganizing selected columns and rows of data.
     
12.  Sankey/Flow Diagram: An icon showing connected bands of varying widths, used to visualize flow and distribution.
     

This description can be used as a prompt for an LLM to define the purpose and characteristics of these chart types in the application context.
