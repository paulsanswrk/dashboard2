This is a Nuxt/Supabase app.

The Optiqo application is a robust business intelligence and data visualization platform. It is designed to assist users in a comprehensive workflow, from connecting to data sources and analyzing information to creating and sharing interactive dashboards and reports. The application appears to be a multi-faceted tool for both technical users (data connection) and business users (dashboard creation and reporting).

Supabase migrations are manually applied.

Please don't start Nuxt yourself. This results in many instances running simultaneously. I start Nuxt manually when needed.

Please don't edit .env file.

There are 2 project in workspace. We work on optiqo-dashboard.

We are on WSL 2.
